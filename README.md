Step 1: Handbrake Video File (720p)

Step 2: Links are case-sensitive. To make things easier, use lower case titles with no spaces. 

Step 3: Upload Handbraked videos to GitHub. 

Step 4: Once uploaded, links to each video file will look like:

Link: https://fruitionist.github.io/VideoHost/videofile.mp4

Note: Must use the video title at the end of each link for it to pop up. Sometimes it'll be an .mp4, other times it's a .m4v. Pay attention to what the title of the video is!
